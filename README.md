[00:53.51] Help me
[00:57.19] I need your love
[00:59.11] Don't walk away
[01:02.33] The dark scares me so
[01:04.47] We're nothing apart
[01:08.45] Let's stay friends forever
[01:13.82] Forever
[01:16.12] Here I stand and face the rain
[01:19.18] I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
[01:25.09] I fear for what tomorrow brings
[01:36.70] Trust me
[01:40.13] For whom I am
[01:42.46] Place all your faith
[01:45.76] Into these hands
[01:47.59] I've got nothing to say
[01:51.62] But, "Let's stay friends forever."
[01:57.08] Forever
[01:59.38] Here I stand and face the rain
[02:02.66] I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
[02:08.33] I fear for what tomorrow brings
[02:15.23] Here I stand and face the rain (Stand and face the rain)
[02:18.84] I know that nothing's gonna be the same again (Nothing's gonna be the same)
[02:23.57] I fear for what tomorrow brings
[02:39.15] Aaahhhhhhaaaaaa (Aaaaahhhhhhaaaa)
[02:39.89] Here I stand and face the rain (Aahhaa)
[02:44.48] Knowing nothing's gonna be the same (Ahhaa)
[02:49.53] Again
[03:13.56] Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
[03:34.10] Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
